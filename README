Compile with 'make' and run with './main.o'

Can switch tool by holding down middle-mouse button (or 'up' arrow or 'shift+T') and dragging mouse cursor to desired tool.

Known bugs and limitations:
* Window resize is "disabled"
* Polygon mode works, but only for convex shapes AND/OR unfilled mode

File directory:
    - main.c
        This includes the main, init and display loop.
    - draw.c
        This includes the draw calls for different shapes. They are all called from within the display loop in main.c
    - callbacks.c
        This file mostly just holds the callbacks for the OpenGL events. However it also manages setting the tool with middle-mouse button/up arrow/shift+T.
    - helper.c
        This file has helper functions to add new shapes to the list of shapes. It also includes the clear functions.
    - dlinked.c (dlinked.h)
        This is the linked list struct as well as all shape structs and constructor calls.

WIP:
    - picker.c is a color picker
